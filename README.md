> List of software and hardware that I use.

## Hardware

* [MacBook Pro (13-inch, 2017)](https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-mac/macbook-pro?product=MPXV2LL/A&step=config) with Touch Bar. It's the base model, I only increased the RAM from 8gb to 16gb.
* [Logitech MX Master 2s](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/product/mx-master-2s-flow) for home usage.
* [Sony MDR-1000X](https://www.sony.com/electronics/headband-headphones/mdr-1000x) headphones. Noise-canceling is a must.
* [OnePlus 3](https://www.sony.com/electronics/headband-headphones/mdr-1000x) still using the *old* version, looking to upgrade to the 5T.

## Everyday Carry

* [Black Incase Classic Sleeve](https://incase.eu/products/protection/macbook-sleeves/classic-sleeve-for-mb-pro-13.html) to give my macbook some protection.
* [Secrid Slimwallet - Original Black](https://secrid.com/en/collection/slimwallet/product/id:601645908010) best small wallet made in holland.
* [Jaybird Freedom Special Edition](https://www.hoofdtelefoonstore.nl/product/798743/jaybird-freedom-special-edition.html) nice for listening to podcasts during my commute.
* [Magic Mouse 2](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MLA02LL/A/magic-mouse-2) on the go. Lightweight and doesn't take up much space.
* [Burton Prospect Backpack Black](https://www.burton.com/us/en/p/prospect-backpack/F18-163381.html?color=16338104717) for daily usage. It's a nice small backpack and everything fits nicely.
* Some other small stuff; charging cables, presenter, usb-sticks etc.
